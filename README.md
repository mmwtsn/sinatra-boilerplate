# Sinatra Boilerplate

## What's Included

A simple project boilerplate for prototyping small ideas in Ruby using Sinatra. The goal of this project was to provide a vanilla TDD environment with all one needs to get started and nothing more. You'll find:

- [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)
- [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) and [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) for testing
- [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) to handle [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [Shotgun](https://github.com/rtomayko/shotgun) to allow for page reloads without server interruption on file change
- Semantic HTML5

## What's Not Included

- a database
- legacy browser support
- page analytics
